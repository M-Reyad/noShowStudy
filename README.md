# noShowStudy
No Show Study for Clinics in Brazil showing the relation governing the case whether to be No-Show
Patients who fail to show up to scheduled appointments or cancel at the last minute- giving the health center no opportunity to fill the appointment slot- are often referred as No Shows. No show appointments result in loss of time and money for health center and disrupts ccontinuity of care of patients.

This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

● "ScheduledDay" tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
● "Neighborhood" indicates the location of the hospital.
● "Scholarship" indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program.
● "No Show" indicates whether the patient existed in the date (No), or got abscent (Yes)


We will discover the main parameters that combine most of the No-Shows with the dataset, Whether they are male/female, the average age, their neighbourhood, scholarhip holders. Whether they recieved an SMS, diagnosed with any type of disease( Hipertension, Diabetes, Alcoholism, Handicapped).

We will try to build the report around the analysis of at least one dependent variable(No-Show) and three independent variables.
